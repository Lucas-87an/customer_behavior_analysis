📊 Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data extraction, exploration, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and reporting.
The goal is to transform raw data into actionable insights using industry-standard tools commonly used by data analysts.

The project includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python

Data cleaning and transformation

SQL analysis using PostgreSQL

Interactive dashboards built in Power BI

A structured analytical report

A presentation created with Gamma AI
